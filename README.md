# Experiments on Adversarial robustness and Self-supervised learning

* The loss function is supposed to be a proxy for the accuracy measure used to analyse a model. But this proxy is not always perfect.

* I explore how the definition of the loss function and the specific method of learning used (self-supervised or supervised) affects the robustness of a model to adversarial examples.

* A synthetic dataset such as 3dident could help us isolate the factors that contribute to adversarial susceptibility. 

* I also create simple toy datasets and showed that it is possible to train a 100\% robust model using the standard supervised training pipeline.
